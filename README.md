## 🧠 Problem Statement
> “Leveraging Frontier Technologies for Delhi MSMEs”

MSMEs in India face challenges such as:
- Frequent machine breakdowns due to lack of predictive maintenance.
- Manual inspection processes leading to defects and production losses.
- Limited access to high-end monitoring solutions due to high cost.

**BharatAI Edge** solves this by providing an **AI-powered plug-and-play device** that integrates easily with existing factory machines and sensors.
